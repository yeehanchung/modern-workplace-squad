Do you know that writing a newsletter is not only to commemorate the past events but also serving as a way to recognize each and every one of your contribution to the squad? Hence, BE PROUD, as a member of the Microsoft Modern Workplace Squad, as a student ambassador, as a student, and as yourself!

Once again, thank you for joining us on the journey of learning and improving. We enjoy having you as part of the family ❤️
