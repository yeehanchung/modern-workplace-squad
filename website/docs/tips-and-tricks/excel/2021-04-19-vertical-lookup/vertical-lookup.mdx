## 😵‍💫 Feeling Dizzy to find what you want among many information?

Here are some tips that will help!

:::note

**V-looup** stands for **"Vertical Lookup"**. It is a function that makes Excel search for a certain value in a column, in order to return a value from a different column in the same row.

:::

Let us begin!

### Step 1

Type in `=vlookup(` as shown below.

### Step 2

As the tooltip suggested, the **loopup_value** should be in cell `E2`.

### Step 3

As for the **table_array** in the tooltip, highlight the whole table that contains the missing information, which is `A1:C6`.

### Step 5

Ensure **comma** is in place, and a **context box** will be showing up as shown below.

:::tips

- **True** means that a "close" match will be returned.
- **False** means that VLOOKUP is looking for an **EXACT** match.
